## My Portfolio Webpage

All original, made from scratch.
Visual Studio Code was used to create this project.
Includes introduction, work and study history, my projects, certificates and skills section.
I used different styles such as hover and slideshows to show what I am capable of creating.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills as I look for a job as a programmer.
