                <p class="vertical-line">
                I an an ex-pharmacist that seeks freedom. Freedom for me is to go back to my roots
                and reconnect with myself, my cultures as well as to connect with other cultures.
                I believed IT ironically is a great tool to connect with the rest of the world.
                I enjoy creating websites and coding so much that I would rather skip my lunch.
                One thing I know for certain about myself is that I am honest, 
                hard-working and I am capable of achieving anything. <br>
                I am now ready to enter the world of tech. I am looking to find someone that can see through my determination, capability and potential.
                I promise you will not regret hiring me.</p>

                                I loved it. People were free, many were foreigners doing what they love. This is when I realised
